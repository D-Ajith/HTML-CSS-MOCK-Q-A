    <p>5. What does a DOCTYPE html do?</p>
    <p>This tells browser document is belongs to html. and the version of html is html5</p>
    <p>6. What happens when DOCTYPE is not given?</p>

    <p>Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser.</p>
    <p>25. Does localStorage throw an error after reaching maximum limits?</p>
    <p>Yes, when the localStorage limit is exceeded, it throws an error, specifically a QuotaExceededError. This happens when you try to store more data than the browser's allocated storage limit (typically around 5MB).0    </p>

    <h1>CSS MOCK Q/A</h1>
    <p>1.What is CSS?</p>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to style the appearance of HTML elements on a web page.</p>
    <p>2.What are the possible ways to apply CSS styles to HTML Document?</p>
    <p>There are three possible ways to apply CSS styles to HTML Document there are:
        1.Inline CSS.
        2.Internal CSS.
        3.External CSS.
    </p>
    <p>3.Z-index</p>
    <p>z-index is the CSS property that controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a page.An element with a higher z-index value will appear in front of an element with a lower z-index value. The property is called “z-index” </p>
    <p>4.Keyframes</p>
    <p>The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code. The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.</p>
    <p>5.Transforms</p>
    <p>The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move,Translate,skew, etc., elements.</p>
    <p>6.Transistions</p>
    <p>CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect.</p>
    <p>7.Pseudo classes</p>
    <p> CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active", like this: a:hover { /* your style here */ }</p>
    <p>8.Pseudo elements</p>
    <p>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s)</p>
    <p>9.CSS selectors</p>
    <p>A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
        *We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

1.Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2.Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3.Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4.Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5.Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    </p>
    <p>10.CSS Combinators</p>
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:
<li>
Descendant combinator (space),
Child combinator (>),
Next sibling combinator (+),
Subsequent-sibling combinator (~).
</li>
    <p>11.Write code to turn border of input box to red if we hover on it(like facebook or instagram login box) </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>12.Explain new features in CSS3.</p>
    <p>The advanced CSS3 features include new selectors, 3D transformations, engaging animation, media queries, Flexbox and grid, multicolumn layout, opacity and box-shadow property, browser compatibility, etc.</p>
    <p>13.CSS Specificity</p>
    <p>CSS Specificity is a fundamental concept in CSS that determines the order of style application. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used, including inline styles, IDs, classes, attributes, and element types. Understanding CSS Specificity is important for: Avoiding styling conflicts.</p>
    <p>14.Positions</p>
    <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).</p>
    <p>15.Flex-box & properties</p>
    <p>The flexible box layout module (usually referred to as flexbox) is a one-dimensional layout model for distributing space between items and includes numerous alignment capabilities.</p>
    <p>16.Grid & its properties</p>
    <p>The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.</p>
    <p>17. Display properties</p>
    <p>The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page. Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline . The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.</p>
